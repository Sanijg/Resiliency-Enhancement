# Resiliency-Enhancement
Enhancing the resilience of distribution system to power outages is very important to keep the critical loads on. 
Hardening measures such as upgraded structures and redundant transmission routes can be an effective but expensive solution. 
Smart measures such as microgrids can act as emergency sources to provide power to the critical loads. 
This paper proposes a distribution system resiliency enhancement using microgrids. Critical loads such as hospitals, 
water supply plants, and data centers are known in a distribution system. But, the number of microgrids, locations and 
capacities are to be found. A case study research method is presented with resiliency enhancement as a main objective function. 
The modified IEEE 37-node system with 6 tie lines is used to implement this method. Depending on the number, priority and 
placement of the critical loads in a distribution system, number of microgrids can be presumed. For this presumed number of 
microgrids, individual case studies are performed placing them at different trial positions on a grid. Each of these topologies 
are studied and compared based on the resilience matrix. This is achieved in MATLAB using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. Once a topology 
with highest resilience function following all the operational and generational constraints is placed, capacity of the microgrids 
can be obtained by adding all the loads and lines losses on its path to critical load/s. Finally, nomograms such as look up tables 
is generated with switching sequences for dealing with faults on the given system.
